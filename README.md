## Hi, I'm Sraddha Suryadevara

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer passionate about turning ideas into code. Here's a little about me:


- I am currently a sophomore at Cornell University studying Computer Science
- I'm passionate about probability and data-driven problem solving
- I also enjoy listening to music, playing tennis, reading, and working out
- I am always ecstatic to talk about my projects, ideas, or those random “what if we made this?” moments
- I'd love to chat! Reach me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sraddha-suryadevara)
